# Paper Dataset Overview

## Selection Rule

The final dataset excludes papers whose Stage 1 to Stage 2 filtering rate is 0%. Each retained paper has raw data, a human-filtered set, a human-annotated set, and explicit symptom/root_cause labels in the final records.

## Overall Counts

| Stage             | Records |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| Stage 1 Raw       | 33822   |
| Stage 2 Filtered  | 4199    |
| Stage 3 Annotated | 2050    |

Final annotated dataset file: `data/processed/stage3.csv`
